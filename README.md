# Expense-Tracker-App
This was my first application created in Flutter framework by Google. It can be used to add and delete Expenses done by user in the current year and it will show the percentage of funds spent over the last 7 days in a Bar Graph. It is a cross-platform application and will have different styles in android and ios. It is a runtime-based application.
